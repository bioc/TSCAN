Description: 
    Provides methods to perform trajectory analysis based on a minimum spanning
    tree constructed from cluster centroids. Computes pseudotemporal cell
    orderings by mapping cells in each cluster (or new cells) to the closest
    edge in the tree. Uses linear modelling to identify differentially
    expressed genes along each path through the tree. Several plotting and
    interactive visualization functions are also implemented.
